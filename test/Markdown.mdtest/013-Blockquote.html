<p>Markdown uses email-style > characters for blockquoting. If you're familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you know how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard wrap the text and put a > before every line:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>This is a blockquote with two paragraphs.</p>
	<p>Donec sit amel nisl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the > before the first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Even though line 2 doesn't start with a > character, it is still part of the blockquote.</p>
	<p>Second paragraph of the same blockquote.</p>
</blockquote>
